# EXERCISE-ML-Data-Pre-Processing-in-Machine-Learning

## Description
This project is an exercise so it has been created based on tutorials, articles, blogs etc.
I assume that I would like to use knowledge, code from it in the next projects, exercises.

## Refrences
Most content has been copied from article [1] and repository [2], in my opion it is amaizng stuff :)
